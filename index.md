# The Great 2016 Retrpspective is Under Construction


## Letter from the Executive Director

2016 has been a big year for The Engine Room as our work and our impact continues to grow. And while the year saw a series of dramatic and unexpected events which at times have tested one of our organisational premises - that evidence and data matter - we believe that our work has never been more relevant or important.

The Engine Room was founded to support activists and advocates to embrace data and technology. We continue to believe that data, evidence, and powerful uses of emerging technology can accelerate the impact that social change organisations work to bring about. We believe that by effectively embracing new tools, organisations can operate and innovate more effectively to serve their communities and reach their advocacy goals.

And 2016 has been significant for making our mission a reality. This year, we supported three times as many organisations as the year before. We also doubled the size of our fee-for-service support to INGOs, supporting projects like Amnesty International’s [Decoders](https://decoders.amnesty.org/) and [Data Centar](http://datacentar.io/en).

Our [Responsible Data](https://responsibledata.io/) program has influenced [debate at the UN](https://www.theengineroom.org/launching-new-responsible-data-in-agriculture-paper/) about rights-based use of data, and taken hold as a [norm-setting force](https://www.ictworks.org/2016/11/21/how-to-develop-and-implement-responsible-data-policies/) in the technology for social good community. Our Matchbox model has spread in [influence](https://www.theengineroom.org/balancing-acts-using-replication-sprints-to-repurpose-technology-without-ignoring-context/) and [impact](https://diig.io). We launched our [Library](https://library.theengineroom.org/) and [Compiler](https://the-compiler.tumblr.com/) to deliver accessible research findings and clear opportunities for creative activists and practitioner organisations.

We also launched a new brand and a new website, published our first formal [organisational strategy](https://www.theengineroom.org/2015-is-so-last-year/), and held our first in-person board meeting.

What is in store for 2017?

We’re planning another big year. We will finalise our move from Norway to a US 501c3, and grow our board. We will build on our work and develop sector-specific strategies in transparency and accountability, human rights, and environmental justice. We will continue to carry out high-impact work using direct support, research, and community development approaches.

All in all, as we begin our 2017, I am proud of our track record of success across programs and projects, and the fantastic people that call The Engine Room home. If you are interested in using data and technology in your social change work, get in touch.

As always, our digital door is open.

## Who we are

### Our Mission

The Engine Room accelerates social change by helping activists, organisations and other social change agents make the most of data and technology to increase their impact.

### How We Work

We use three mechanisms to achieve our goals: direct support, research, and communities of practice. Each stream of work has its own dynamic and workflow, and connects with our sector-focus in different ways. Our methodology has grown organically and pragmatically over the six years we have been working - and continues to evolve.

We pride ourselves on original and effective solutions that deliver big impact. We are responsive, agile and global, and apply our expertise to real world challenges.

### Our Team

Our organisational strength lies in our diverse skills - with coders, policy advocates, data analysts, journalists, storytellers, designers and sociologists on our team. This year our committed team grew to 15 based in 10 countries on four continents. And the internet is our office.

### 2016 Areas of Focus

#### Our Sector Approach
The Engine Room partners with organisations working toward social good outcomes. Through the years, we have worked with organisations working towards diverse missions. Despite that diversity, 	we have carried out focused work in a number of sectors and communities and plan to continue sector-specific strategies.

What sectors did we work in most in 2016?

* transparency and accountability (extractives transparency, open government, open contracting, freedom of information);
* human rights (grave crimes, freedom of expression, and documentation)
* environmental protection (deforestation, forest peoples’ rights)

There are obvious interconnections between these issue areas that we continue to explore. In 2017, we will concentrate on work in these sectors, and will also work with partners and colleagues in other sectors like the fields of humanitarian work, digital security, human development and other social change sectors where we think we will add particular value.

What we do in each sector varies, but generally, we used the formats most prominent in our toolbox including:
* our Matchbox partnerships,
* replication sprints,
* light touch support,
* strategic advice to INGOs and funders,
research,
* and event design and facilitation.

#### Transparency and Accountability

In 2016 we provided support to T/A activists around the world to improve the management of public resources, expose and reduce corruption, and improve government service delivery.

In the course of the year, we continued our partnership with [three former](https://www.theengineroom.org/pilot-report/) Matchbox partners, organised our [first replication sprint in Southern Africa](https://www.theengineroom.org/balancing-acts-using-replication-sprints-to-repurpose-technology-without-ignoring-context/), selected [two new Matchbox partners in Latin America](https://www.theengineroom.org/meet-our-new-matchbox-partners-in-latin-america-causa-natura-memoria-y-ciudadania/). We also rolled out the [selection process for new Matchbox partners in Sub-Saharan Africa](https://www.theengineroom.org/driving-social-change-in-sub-saharan-africa-apply-for-matchbox-partnership-now/), and for our [second replication sprint in Eastern Europe and the Balkans](https://www.theengineroom.org/driving-social-change-in-sub-saharan-africa-apply-for-matchbox-partnership-now/).

We helped the [Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR)](https://www.theengineroom.org/projects/institute-for-public-policy-research/) in their work to prevent corruption in the Namibian mining industry, through unlocking and organizing data around oil and gas exploration licences. We used the data and technology components of IPPR’s [Transparent Oil](https://namibia.transparentoil.org/) platform in [our first replication sprint](https://www.theengineroom.org/so-the-database-or-platform-makes-information-public-now-what/) to create two new structured databases for our partners in [Malawi](https://malawi.diig.io/) and [Zimbabwe](https://zimbabwe.diig.io/), with supporting strategies around data management and advocacy.

With our help, [¿Quién Compró?](https://www.theengineroom.org/projects/quien-compro/) in Mexico started to [expose fraudulent expenditures](http://www.quiencompro.org/) of politicians, after digitizing and systematizing almost 16.000 expense receipts from the Mexican parliament. In 2016 we started working with another Mexican organization [Causa Natura](http://causanatura.org/), to empower the fishermen and women of Mexico through unlocking information about government subsidies. We also began a new partnership with Japiqay from Peru. This is a project that tells the story of systematic corruption in Peru over the past 30 years - through a combination of data analysis, visualizations, storytelling, and advocacy.

The support we provided for T/A activists focused on:
* Data (collection, modeling, visualization, scraping, digitization, analysis);
* Technology (front-end design, development, user centered research and design);
* Strategy (project inception, advocacy, fundraising, community building);
* Sector specific expertise (contracting, extractives licences, politician’s expenses, budgets, subsidies, anti-corruption reform, influence mapping, etc.)

In addition to our Matchbox partnerships and replication sprints, we provided less intensive support to a number of organizations. This light touch support included matchmaking, resource curation, strategic planning, and idea refinement. We provided this support to organisations from: Argentina, Bangladesh, Brasil, Chile, Croatia, Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Kosovo, Kyrgyzstan, Madagascar, Mexico, Morocco, Myanmar, Nepal, Peru, Romania, Serbia, South Africa and Zimbabwe.

#### Human Rights
In a data saturated world with rapidly changing technology, the enforcement of universal, fundamental and inalienable human rights requires new tactics and skills. It’s not enough to simply carry on as before. Every day at The Engine Room we work with rights-focused organisations to support them to take advantage of these new technologies, while at the same time navigating the risks that these new technologies present to their organisation, and their personnel.

What did our human rights work look like in 2016?

This year we maintained strong relationships with leading human rights organisations as well as smaller groups of human rights defenders, and played a bridging role between researchers working on human rights and technology issues, and the organisations for whom that research could be influential.

Building on our [microtasking research](https://library.theengineroom.org/microtasking) in 2015, we worked with Amnesty International to develop their [Decoders project](https://decoders.amnesty.org/) (see Highlights above for more information). This project uses the tremendous resources of AI’s volunteer network to conduct human rights research using microtasking.

We partnered again with Amnesty International, and Benetech, to highlight how digital data could be better integrated into the work of human rights researchers.The resulting guide, [DatNav](https://www.theengineroom.org/datnav-digital-data-in-human-rights-research/), helps researchers navigate the world of digital data for human rights.

In addition to developing resources for human rights researchers interested in using digital data, we also carried out research on the [tool ecosystem for human rights documentation](https://www.theengineroom.org/technology-tools-human-rights/). The purpose of this research - funded by the Oak Foundation - was to understand the current landscape, and examine needs and perception gaps. We spoke to tool developers and human rights defenders to see how those communities perspective connected - and didn’t. Our findings were formatted into a [Library entry](https://library.theengineroom.org/humanrights-tech/).

Human rights partners were also a significant part of our Light Touch Support work in 2016. We worked with organisations such as:

* a coalition of organisations in Egypt establishing sustainable and secure technology tools for their shared use;
* the Human Rights, Big Data and Technology project from the University of Essex; and
* several refugee and migrant-rights related groups to help them better understand their technology needs for increased coordination.

Our human rights work is not limited to supporting human rights organisations. It also includes supporting and advocating for rights-based use of data by the social sector. Our [Responsible Data Reflection Stories](https://responsibledata.io/reflection-stories/uncertainty-statistics/) documented nine case studies on the practical challenges faced in advocacy, including one focused on the struggles experienced by organisations working on gathering data about casualties in the Syrian civil war. (You can read more about our Responsible Data work in the section below.)

We also went to several human rights related events, the most notable of which:
* [AWID Forum](https://www.awid.org/), a gathering of feminist activists and women’s rights defenders primarily from the global South, to better understand their technology and data challenges.
* A [small, week-long workshop held by Global Voices](https://rising.globalvoices.org/exchange/) with women’s rights defenders from around the world to share their strategies for digital advocacy.
* And we held held a [Responsible Data Forum on Human Rights Documentation at this year’s Rights Con in San Francisco](https://responsibledata.io/forums/human-rights-documentation-follow-up/).

## Operational Achievements

All of this work is built atop a foundation of operational growth and strength. In 2016 we recruited our new Operations Director, Roz Zavras, whose awesome organisational skills have been put to the test migrating our legal operations from Norway to the USA. The Engine Room is now fully registered in New York State, and we continue to wind down our Norwegian operations.

We’ve also been working on our HR systems, developing transparent payscales for all staff, new performance review and professional development processes, and launching our first [Engine Room Research Internship](https://www.theengineroom.org/digital-butterflies-and-weight-of-distance-intern-reflection/), This year we held our first company workshop on wellbeing in the organisation.

This year we also launched a [new website and brand identity](https://www.theengineroom.org/).

The Engine Room continues to grow rapidly. We have watched peer organisations navigate the challenges of rapid growth - some with more success than others. We know that our team, values, culture and skills are a precious resource that we must protect to ensure we continue to deliver excellent, innovative work in the future.
